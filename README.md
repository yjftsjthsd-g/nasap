nasap ***(news as simple as possible)***
========================================

For those that dislike news readers which are too complicated, too _social_ and
often allow tracking of my habbits and interests.

_nasap_ solves this by fetching a full article directly from the source,
stripping everything we're not interested in and output only plain text readable
with practically anything.

Requires python (currently only 2.x supported), feedparser, python-readability
and pypandoc.

See LICENSE, AUTHORS and TODO for more information.
